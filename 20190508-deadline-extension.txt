Subject: [ACM ICN 2019] Deadline extension for paper submission - #19 "Secure Scuttlebutt: An..."

Dear Christian Tschudin,

Thanks very much for registering your paper for the ACM ICN’19 conference.
We’re enthusiastic about the conference program, and look forward to
receiving your full paper submission!

We’re writing to note two points that have recently come up in questions
from potential authors and in reviewing early submissions - one about paper
formatting and one about anonymity. We discuss these points briefly below.
First, however, we would like to inform you of a short extension to the
submission deadline to help you be sure these points are addressed.

DEADLINE EXTENSION:

To help you complete your paper comfortably while ensuring that you’re able
to address these points, we are _extending_ the paper submission deadline
to the end of the day Tuesday, May 14 Anywhere on Earth (AoE). Please be
sure your paper is submitted by this deadline, as reviewing will begin
immediately after.

PAPER FORMATTING AND ANONYMITY CONSIDERATIONS:

In preparing your full submission, please note the following:

1) Paper Formatting: We've received several questions and comments about
the intent of the paper formatting instructions posted with the CFP. To
help clarify the objective of those instructions, we summarize here:

a) The review copy of your paper should be formatted using the standard ACM
conference paper template formatting, _except_ that you should use a 10
point font. (Note that the standard ACM templates use 9 point.)

b) For final copies of accepted papers, the ACM templates will be used “off
the shelf”, with 9pt fonts. This will give you a little extra room in the
final version of your paper to address reviewer comments, add clarifying
detail, etc., leading to noticeably stronger papers overall.

Some further information about paper formatting is given at the end of this
email.


2) Submission Anonymity: As you will recall the conference has switched to
a policy of double blind reviewing this year. However we have received some
early paper submissions that were not anonymized, but instead included
author names and other identifying information as in past years.

In preparing your final submission, _please_ be sure to note the
information in the section labeled “Paper Anonymity” at
https://conferences.sigcomm.org/acm-icn/2019/submissions.php, and anonymize
your paper accordingly.

Thank you again for your interest in ACM ICN’19, and please feel free to
contact us at icn19-tpc@ee.ucl.ac.uk if you have further questions related
to formatting or submitting your paper.

Further information about paper formatting:

- Latex users: Both the current ACM standard templates at
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template and the alternate
template linked from the conference website
(https://github.com/conference-websites/acmart-sigproc-template/blob/master/sample-sigconf.tex)
includes all the required formatting setting.

To request a 10pt font instead of the built-in 9pt in the default ACM
template, you can use the command:

\documentclass[10pt,sigconf]{acmart}

at the top of your main .tex file.

- MS Word users: The current version of the MS Word template linked from
ACM’s website uses 9pt fonts. Please ensure that you change the body text
font size to 10pt when utilizing this template.
