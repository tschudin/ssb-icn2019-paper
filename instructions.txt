Subject: [ACM ICN 2019] Camera-Ready Instructions - Submission #19 "Secure Scuttlebutt: An..."

Dear Christian Tschudin,

Congratulations once again for your accepted paper. Please find below
Camera-Ready Instructions which will help you prepare the final version of
your paper. Please note, the deadline to submit your camera-ready paper is
the 21st of August 2019 and submissions will be handled through HotCRP.


======== Camera-Ready Instructions ========

Before submitting camera-ready papers, authors of accepted papers will need
to complete the ACM rights management form. You will be notified once these
forms are available and ready to sign.

After completing their rights management form, authors will be emailed the
correct rights management text and bibliographic strip to place within
their paper. It is essential that authors enter the text into their paper.

As rights management emails are sent from an automated system, there is a
chance that emails sent will wind up in SPAM folders. Please make sure that
you and your authors set email SPAM settings to allow emails from
rightsreview@acm.org.

ACM ICN 2019 will use HotCRP for collecting camera-ready submission
(https://icn19.hotcrp.com/). Please prepare your paper according to the
instructions provided below:

+ Full papers should be no more than ten (10) single-spaced pages,
including figures, tables, appendices, etc. References do NOT count against
the page limit. In order to ensure adequate citation of related work, extra
pages of references are allowed (and encouraged).
+ For short papers the limit is six (6) pages, also EXCLUDING references.
+ Font size for the main text is the same as in the provided template (9
pt). This is in contrast to the 10pt font in the initial submission to
allow authors extra space to address reviewers’ comments.

+ For posters and demos the page limit is two (2) single-spaced pages,
INCLUDING references.
+ Include names and affiliations of all authors in the title page.
+ Please do NOT number the pages of your camera-ready paper.

+ ACM MSWord and LaTeX templates and related information may be found at:
https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template
Please follow the instructions on that page for using the templates to
prepare your camera-ready paper copy.
++ NOTE: LaTeX users should select the “sigconf” document subclass
("\documentclass[sigconf]{acmart}”)
++ NOTE: ACM templates use a body text font size of 9pt. Please DO NOT
alter this size for your camera-ready paper. This is in contrast to the
10pt font requested for your initial submission. This is to allow authors
some extra space to address reviewers’ comments.
++ NOTE: please contact the conference publications chair Tian Song
<songtian@bit.edu.cn> if you have questions about use of the ACM document
templates or generating your camera-ready final paper copy.

+ As described on the above template webpage, the authors should provide
proper indexing information in the final version according to the ACM
Computing Classification System (CCS). More information about the ACM CCS
is available on ACM CCS website.
+ Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words.
+ Submit the source files and PDF (Portable Document Format) of your
camera-ready paper. Avoid using any special characters or non-standard
fonts. We must be able to display and print your submission exactly as we
receive it using only standard tools and printers, so we strongly suggest
that you use only standard fonts embedded in the PDF file.
+ Ensure that labels and symbols used in graphs and figures are legible,
including the font sizes of tick marks, axis labels, legends, etc.
Limit the file size to less than 15MB. Contact the TPC chairs if you have a
file larger than 15 MB.

PDF files must be prepared using Type 1, OpenType, or TrueType fonts
(scalable), and not Type 3 (bit-mapped). Virtually all modern LaTeX
installations will meet this condition; only use of the very old original
Computer Modern fonts is likely to cause a problem.

All fonts must be embedded within your submitted PDF file. Any PDF that is
not uploaded with fonts embedded will need to be corrected. Most modern
document preparation workflows now embed fonts by default. To help you
confirm that this requirement is met and fix it if necessary, ACM has
provided some documentation at:
https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/word-to-pdf-instructions-.txt.

Note however the the portion of this documentation concerned with
generating PDF files is quite old and assumes the use of Adobe Acrobat
Distiller; please consult local expertise or the conference publications
chair if this doesn’t match your needs.

=====================================

Please contact the publications chair Tian Song <songtian@bit.edu.cn>, or
the TPC Chairs <icn19-tpc@ee.ucl.ac.uk> as appropriate with any questions
or concerns.
